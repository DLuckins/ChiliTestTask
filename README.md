# flutter_application_1

A new Flutter project.

## Flutter version

In this project I used flutter version : 3.27.1

## Unfulfilled requirements

I haven't been able to complete one bonus requirement: Page navigation is separate from page widget code (a Coordinator pattern or similar);
To complete it I tried to use go_router flutter package, but I had some troubles with getting it to work with bloc logic, also with go_router I haven't been able to pass the Map<String, dynamic> gif object so easily. So in the end navigation is done using default Navigator class and it isn't stored in one file.
